![alt text](http://url/to/img.png)


## Description

This is a **data cleaning** and **data wrangling** project for *Ironhack*. 
The purpose of the project is to analyse, clean, sort and display the data in a way that fulfills the purpose of proving a certain hypothesis right. 
I have worked with a shark attack dataset extracted from Kaggle (the link can be found  further down).

## Process

**Step 1**:   read the dataset

**Step 2**:   get rid of completely empty columns

**Step 3**:   create a new df that is clean

**Step 4**:   change NaN values for unknown in columns of interest

**Step 5**:   correct the year decimals with regex

**Step 6**:   dissect tiger sharks attack by year and plot by year

**Step 7**:   dissect tiger sharks attack by sex and plot by year

**Step 8**:   create a table with shark attacks by year and sex and show %
