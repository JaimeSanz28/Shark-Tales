# Shark-Tales

![Shark Tale](shark_tale.jpg)



## Description

This is a **data cleaning** and **data wrangling** project for *Ironhack*. 
The purpose of the project is to analyse, clean, sort and display the data in a way that fulfills the purpose of proving wether a specific hypothesis right or wrong. 
I have worked with a shark attack dataset extracted from Kaggle (the link can be found  further down).

## Hypothesis

```bash
White sharks have killed more men than women over the past 5 decades.
```

## Process


### Data Cleaning

**Step 1**:   read the dataframe

**Step 2**:   get rid of completely empty columns

**Step 3**:   create a new df that is clean

**Step 4**:   change NaN values for 'unknown' in "Species"

**Step 5**:   remove rows with 'unknown species' in "Species" column

**Step 6**:   clear the "Date" column

**Step 7**:   dissect white shark attacks by date


### Data Wrangling

**Step 1**:   display and plot white shark attacks by month 

**Step 2**:   plot attacks by month and sex of victim

**Step 3**:   reflect on hypothesis
